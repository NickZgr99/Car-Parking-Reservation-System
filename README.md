about the parked hours, the total price and will give them a farewell message. It will also remove the
details of the vehicle from the parking lot it has used.

Each floor has 5 areas, while each area has 10 parking lots.

The Parking charges 3$/Hour of use per vehicle. (Only for customers)

THREE DIFFERENT MENUS

The parking reservation system can be used by 3 types of users, namely a user, a staff member and an admin. 
Admins and staff members can use the parking any time of the day for free, while users pay for a reservation depending on the number of hours
their vehicle will be parked for.
